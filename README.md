This service will be used to screen engineering interview candidates in lieu of the standard 4 questions we normally ask. A completed solution should result in the next step of the interview process: inviting the candidate to the office for an in person interview.

## Requirements
* WILL assess a candidates competence in the following areas:
  * using an HTTP API
  * modeling data / using common data structures
  * writing well factored code
  * testing code
  
* WILL provide a means to submit a correct "answer" along with the source code artifact that was used to generate that answer
  * all submissions should be checked for fraud (checksum / diff)
  * a correct submission should trigger a notification to an engineer for review

* WILL NOT require candidates to use a specific language or framework
